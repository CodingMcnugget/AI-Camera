Nostalgia is a widely discussed and commonly experienced emotion. However, it doesn't necessarily have to be related to one's actual hometown or personal past. In fact, I believe that nostalgia is not a soft and comforting memory, but rather a product of imagination, a byproduct of the brain's extensive embellishment.

When I imagine the scene of sending my child off to college, saying goodbye at the front door, it evokes a sense of nostalgic melancholy, even though I am currently 25 years old and far from having a family or sending a child to school. Similar imaginary and emotionally rich scenarios are countless. A popular trend online, called Backrooms, is a recent representation of nostalgia. Backrooms originated from an image posted by an anonymous user on the imageboard website 4Chan in 2019. Initially, Backrooms were depicted as an office maze made up of randomly generated rooms of varying sizes (Wikipedia). But it didn't stop there; subsequent Backrooms works feature rooms of various eras and styles. Their commonality is that they present a familiar yet strange scene, regardless of style, devoid of people but filled with traces of human presence. This type of space is referred to as Liminal Space, which can be imagined as a dreamlike, deserted city.

I have been pondering why such spaces evoke nostalgia. Firstly, nostalgia is not limited to my real memories and experiences, as I have never actually been to a Liminal Space. Secondly, nostalgia does not stem from a specific aesthetic creation, as Liminal Spaces come in various styles, including futuristic ones. I believe the primary principle of nostalgia is that it contain traces that spark imagination. An empty city, devoid of people but with traces of human presence, is like seeing a footprint in a forest, inevitably making me wonder what happened. I think Liminal Spaces cause viewers to subconsciously engage in extensive thinking and imagining about the potential or impending events in that space. The emotional product of this extensive thinking and imagination is nostalgia.

Therefore, I created this camera. The purpose of this camera is to automatically detect people and remove them from photographs.

I used a Raspberry Pi 5 and a webcam to build the physical part of this camera. When the Raspberry Pi is turned on, it automatically logs into my website. The frontend website displays the webcam feed in full screen, and if the user presses the shutter button, the screenshot of that moment is sent to the backend. The backend processes the photo through an API. I used two APIs: one API is responsible for segmenting the image and creating bounding boxes around people, then an AI recognizes the background and fills in the background within the bounding boxes to remove the people. The second API is responsible for image enhancement to compensate for any loss in image quality during the first AI processing.
